# Stacks and Queues
 * ***A stack is a collection that is based on the last-in-first-out (LIFO) policy. By tradition, we name the stack insert method push() and the stack remove operation pop(). We also include a method to test whether the stack is empty.***
 * ***A queue supports the insert and remove operations using a first-in first-out (FIFO) discipline. By convention, we name the queue insert operation enqueue and the remove operation dequeue.***

## Challenge
***Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated. And Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.***
## Approach & Efficiency
***It took around four hours to get the Idea. The big O was O(1) for every method that I used.***

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
### Stack methods
* stack():create an empty stack.
* boolean isEmpty():is the stack empty?
* void push(T value):push a value onto the stack.
* T pop():return and remove the value that was inserted most recently.
* T peek():return the most recently inserted element on the stack (without removing it).

### Queue methods
* queue():create an empty queue.
* boolean isEmpty():is the queue empty? 
* void enqueue(T value):insert a value onto the queue
* T dequeue():return and remove the value that was inserted last recently.
